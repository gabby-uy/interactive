  <h1>Phoenix Metrocenter</h1>
  <p>
  Two weeks ago, in Phoenix, auctioning began at the vacant Metrocenter mall, which closed in June, and will continue on a weekly basis through January. By then, the auctioneers expect to have listed about 1,000 lots.
  </p><p>
  So far their catalog has included a collection of 37 fire extinguishers (sold for $140); a neon Wetzel’s Pretzels sign ($750); a large mall directory ($275); a security system of cages so large they can only be described as multi-human size ($325). Upcoming items include 25 food court tables; the plexiglass bins that held candy in a candy store; the contents of an empty Victoria’s Secret; a lot of nine mannequin torsos (six female, three male).
  </p><p>
  While a majority of buyers at these auctions are surplus buyers and may be more interested in things like light fixtures and racks, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/EJ's+Auction+%26+Appraisal/@33.6414056,-112.1846147,3a,90y,15.06h,89.78t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sPNcdopqFepAAAAQo8CRHbA!2e0!3e2!7i14000!8i7000!4m7!3m6!1s0x872b6bce378e62f3:0x8aa1e8f062b33920!8m2!3d33.6415739!4d-112.1846992!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F1pp2vbprt?entry=ttu">EJ’s Auction and Appraisal</a>, which is running the Metrocenter purge, estimates about 30 percent are collectors.
  </p><p>
  “There is a very, very strong market for signage: anything neon and retro, but even the newer stuff has value on the collector market,” said Erik Hoyer, the company’s chief executive.
  </p><p>
  When it opened in 1973, Metrocenter was Arizona’s largest mall, a symbol of new affluence in a suburbanized desert. Inside, families skated on an ice rink; outside, teenagers cruised around the parking lot (and, as adults, were inspired to cruise again — “one last cruise!” — when they heard Metrocenter was closing).
  </p><p>
  Mr. Hoyer, 55, was one of those teenagers, “causing trouble, doing what teenagers do,” he said. “And so we knew that some of the items would pique interest of people my age specifically. There’s a lot of nostalgia there.”
  </p><p>
  In some corridors of Metrocenter, the floors are covered in plastic BBs from a recent airsoft game — which is similar to paintball (without the paint) and simulates military combat. At an auction preview last week, small white balls crunched underfoot.
  </p><p>
  Somewhere in the mall, a radio played the Cranberries’ <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0gEyKnHvgkrkBM6fbeHdwK?si=f7d6d67c43e44c4d">“Linger,”</a> which echoed eerily off the walls, stretching as far as it could through 1.3 million square feet. While most Metrocenter stores were stripped of anything but lights and displays (and those mannequins), their back rooms look ransacked, as if they’d been quickly abandoned.
  </p><p>
  Documents were thrown on the floor or left forgotten on a desk. Here was someone’s résumé: a 2014 graduate whose skills included self-motivation and graphic design. There was a letter from the corporation commission, informing a jewelry store that its article of organization had been approved.
  </p><p>
  “It can be a little bit spooky out there,” Mr. Hoyer said. Recently, he watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3fx6TugN7g">“Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure,”</a> which was filmed in part at Metrocenter, to see if he could recognize any fixtures still in place. He couldn’t. The mall has had too many lives. And deaths.
  </p><p>
  Erik Pierson, 39, a dead malls enthusiast in Arizona, went to the first auction preview and plans to attend more, though he has not placed a bid yet. Mostly he has enjoyed the experience of seeing the mall in its final, uncanny form.
  </p><p>
  “I went there as a kid and obviously I’ve covered it quite a bit on my YouTube channel,” he said. “But that was the first time that I had been in it since it was closed. And it was bizarre. It was kind of bittersweet because I love that mall.”
  </p><p>
  Some people remember the ice skating rink. Others remember the huge fountain that did timed shows, spitting water up and up, as high as the second floor, before it came crashing down onto tile with loud splats. The fountain was covered years ago.
